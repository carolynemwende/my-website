<h2> <u>TREATMENT AND ROLE OF WOMEN IN<em style="color: darkblue;"> HOME GOING </em></u></h2>
<h3>Treatments</h3>
<p>Women have been treated in diffrent ways in the book.It is the hope of everyone that women should be treated well but in the book the statement appears as an irony. This has been shown clear by several characters who include: Effia, Essi, Maame and so many other women in the book.<br>
<ul><li>women are physically assulted for no reason.</li>
	<img src="img/asault.jpg">
	<p>Big man beats up Essi in order to mantain his macho image and not be mistake for weakling.
	He also beats up Abronoma when he drops few drops of water even after passing the test. The reason is too mere to be compared by the beating that she gets. She is so hurt that she can't even work. Maame ends up doing her dudy that night. 
<li>They are subjected to slavery.</li>
	<img src="img/chained.jpg">
	<p> In the book women are subjected to slavery an act that is tormenting,Essi and other women are locked in the dungeons where they are even not allowed to see light. In there they are not fed well which makes some to die. The space is limite and this makes then to be on top of each other. </p>
<li>They suffer victimization and are treated as commodities.</li>
	<p>This is the worst of all.When Ohene fails to get good harvest the whole village blames Abena for ill lack.Ohene promises to marry her only when the harvest improves but eventually betrays her and abardons her pregnancy for another woman's hand in marriage.</p>
<li>Women bear the brunt of suffering</li>
	<p>Even though men are also subjected to slavery and segregation,women bear the brunt of the suffering. This is because they struggle under the institution of patriarchy and slavery.Men take control of everything and women are not given the chance of expressing themselves in anyway</p>

	In summation, women are treated very bad and harshly in the book. There freedom is limited. They are subjected to alot of pain of which is making them to suffer much. The worst of all is that they can't make their own decision for they are subjected to the patriachy state. They are subjected to all sorts of painstarting from sexual assultion,slavery,beating and much more.






	<h3>Roles</h3>

	<p>women have had alot of roles in the society as depected by the book.

Willie and Akua form strong relationships with their children and grandchildren, which gives them happiness and peace in old age. At the end they live happily in one family. </p>
			<br>
			<li>Work to take care of the family.</li>
			<p>Women are the nes taking care of the family and children. Baaba is the one who takes care of Fiifi and Effia even though she treats her badly. she also takes care of her husband and makes  sure that the family is fed. Maame also does the same thing with her family with the help of her daughter Essi. She makes sure that all is well.</p>

<h2>Treatment and role of women today.</h2>

<h3>Treatment.</h3>
<p>Women today are a diffrent picture from what we knew before.This means that their treatment has also changed much.Those days when a woman was being made to suffer is no longer there any more and it is there then it is in limited quantity.<br><br>
	Today I feel that women are being treated well not like before or as depicted by the book home going.
	No more slavery since women have there own rights to follow and incase of boken rules they report to the authority.<br><br>
	They are being prioritised and  given the first opgtions. Before women used to be left behind in everything but it is not the case anymore.They have the power to speak for themselves and be heard at the same time.



	<h4>Today the treatment of a woman has realy changed and it is not like before anymore. This is a great thing and an improvement that has brought about alot of changes in how women are treated out there. </h4>




.
<h3>Roles of women today.</h3>


women today have the same roles as women of yesterday,the only diffrence is that they make their own decision and do not do things out of pressure of anyone in the society.

<ul>
	<li>Change the world.</li>
	 <img src="img/akira.jpg"
	<p>Today I feel that we are given the authority of changing the world. This is through diffrent skills that we are  being offered. For us today we have venture in technology, this means that at the end we have to give back to the society. In this we will be playing a big role in changing our world of today.</p>
	<li>Taking care of themselves and family.</li>
	<img src="img/images.jpg">
	<p>Like before women today also have the obligation of taking care of their lives and their children for the betterness of everyone.Today we see women work to provide for their families and make sure that they are happy.</p>
	


</ul>

<h3>To me women are the best people in the world. They have the sense  of humanity and a good example is my mother. They have taken care of us since younghood upto where we are today. <strong style="color: blue;">THANKS TO OUR MOTHERS.</h3></strong>
